        <p>
            I spend my free time doing one of a couple of things. One, I spend as much time with my son as possible. I hope to enjoy charter fishing with him once he is old enough to get out on Lake Michigan. Two, I like to play video games with the buds. Three, enjoy a cold Miller Lite with the buds on the weekends.

        <h2>Developing</h2>
        <p>
            Currently I am enrolled in the C#.NET Daytime course at Grand Circus. Once that is completed I would like to spend time learning JavaScript or HTML.

        <h2>Hometown</h2>
        <p>
            I was born in Flint, MI. We lived just outside the downtown area until just before my 5th birthday. We then moved to a suburb just outside Kalamazoo, MI called Mattawan. I spent kindergarden through senior year living there. I now live with my wife and son in Portage, MI.
